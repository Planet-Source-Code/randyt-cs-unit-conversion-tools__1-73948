Temperature Controls use a DIFFERENT conversion algorithm than the other conversion categories in this distribution. I have placed several different temperature conversion controls and a class that are similar to those that can be created with the included ‘Unit Conversion Class / User-Control Maker Tool’. Use one of these temperature controls or the class when you need to use a temperature control or Temperature class in your application.
