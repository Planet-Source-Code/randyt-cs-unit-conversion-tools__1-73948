Deflecting Beam Load Cell Designer Application:

The unit-conversion controls used in this example program were created with the included ‘Unit Conversion Class / User-Control Maker Tool’.

Select a beam-material from the dropdown-list, or change one or more of the system variables in the unit-conversion controls. Then click on one of the yellow-highlighted buttons to solve the load-cell system for that variable. Once the system is solved you can plot either ‘Stress vs. Length’ or ‘Force vs. Deflection’ for the system by clicking the appropriate plot button.

The unit-conversion controls in this example are also ScriptControl enabled. For instance you can enter math calculation values such as '1/8' into the Thickness unit control.
You can download the ScriptControl from Microsoft if you do not have it.
Just Google "Microsoft ScriptControl 1.0".

NOTE: The input textbox of the unit-conversion controls can be toggled between ‘no format’ and ‘scientific format’ by double-clicking in the control's textbox.

NOTE: This program is not input range protected. You can enter unreasonable values into the unit controls that will cause the program to crash! For instance, enter zero or 1E308 into any of the unit-conversion controls and see what happens when you solve for another variable.
