This example program shows how to use unit conversion classes that were generated with the included ‘Unit Conversion Class / User-Control Maker Tool’ to implement a simple area-calculator with some selectable units in the combo boxes. The user can work with whatever units they please while the programmer works with whatever mathematically consistent set of units they please - without ever having to perform unit conversions in code and thus avoiding the risk of making a unit conversion error.
