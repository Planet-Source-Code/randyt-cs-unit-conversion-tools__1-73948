This program is an in-development beta version. I have not found a way to get the height
of the columnheader buttons. So I added an offset by hand to make the input text box line 
up with the listview grid. The text box may not line up properly with the listview grid
on your system. This part of the program could be implemented much better!


Select a unit category from the left list box.

Select a specific unit from the listview box.

Enter a new value for the specific unit in the blue-background text box and press [Enter].
All other units in the listview will be converted to match the changed unit.

Math entry is allowed in the blue-background text box by the Microsoft ScriptControl 1.0.
You can download the ScriptControl from Microsoft if you do not have it.
Just Google "Microsoft ScriptControl 1.0".
